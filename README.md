This project is about:
* Making it easier for [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/) users to send documentation, tips, suggestions and resources (git knowledge is not a requirement despite the project being hosted on github).
* Assisting in getting documentation contributions QA'd and potentially submitted to the official [qubes-doc](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc) repository
* Hosting (or linking to) projects, resources or documentation that for some reason do not fit for inclusion in the official project

Relevant pages and guides:
* [Contributing content without any git knowledge](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Qubes-Community/blob/master/docs/no-git-submissions.md)
* [Qubes Community's documentation and resources](https://github.com/Qubes-Community/Qubes-Community)
