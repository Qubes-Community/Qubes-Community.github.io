This project is about:
* [making it easier]() for people to send documentation, tips, suggestions, ... related to Qubes OS (git knowledge is a plus but is not a requirement despite the project being hosted on a git platform).
* [assisting]() in getting documentation contributions QA'd and submitted to the official qubes-doc repository
* [hosting or linking]() to Qubes OS related documentation projects that for some reason don't fit for inclusion in the official project.
